# spark-cluster-docker
Docker images for Spark standalone cluster

## How to use

### Launch simple cluster

You can use directly docker-compose with the command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

It will build the images and run one master and one worker.


### Tuning

You can add new workers by copying the worker1 part and changing the number.
